## Project Description
A satirical "Digital Theme Park" web application that creates a psychologically manipulative experience designed to derail productivity through humor, AI, and chaos. Features four interactive "booths" that use addictive design patterns to keep users engaged in meaningless activities.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are too productive and focused on their work. They need a way to completely derail their productivity and waste time in the most entertaining way possible. The world needs more digital distractions that make users question their life choices while providing dopamine hits through meaningless interactions.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A digital theme park with four interactive "attractions" that use psychological manipulation techniques to create addictive, time-wasting experiences. Each booth employs different psychological triggers like variable reward schedules, social proof, loss aversion, and curiosity gaps to keep users engaged in completely useless activities.
