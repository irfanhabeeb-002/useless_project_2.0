## Audio Assets for Psychological Warfare

### Core Psychological Triggers:

- **maybe-leave.mp3** (670KB) - Plays immediately on "maybe" selection (uncertainty creation)

### Audio Design Philosophy:

ðŸŽ­ **Psychological Warfare**: Each audio file evokes specific emotional responses
- **Yes audio**: Sad, pleading, or desperate sounds to induce guilt
- **No audio**: Relieved but with underlying manipulation tones
- **Maybe audio**: Creates uncertainty and confusion through audio design

ðŸ”Š **Technical Specifications**:
- **Format**: MP3
- **Quality**: Variable bitrate (149KB - 670KB)
- **Duration**: Optimized for psychological impact
- **Volume**: Normalized for consistent playback across devices

## Psychological Impact Strategy:

1. **Guilt Induction**: Audio plays only when user tries to leave
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Messages change based on user behavior
3. **Pattern Interruption**: Unexpected audio triggers create psychological hooks
4. **Lingering Presence**: Audio maintains emotional connection with the site
