# Audio Assets for Psychological Warfare

This folder contains audio files that are strategically designed to create emotional manipulation and psychological hooks.

## Required Audio Files:

### Core Psychological Triggers:
- **yes-leave.mp3** - Plays when user selects "yes" and switches tabs (guilt trigger)
- **no-leave.mp3** - Plays when user selects "no" and switches tabs (emotional manipulation)
- **maybe-leave.mp3** - Plays immediately on "maybe" selection (uncertainty creation)

### Background Loop (Optional):
- **background-loop.mp3** - Starts 30 seconds after "maybe" selection (lingering presence)

## Audio Design Philosophy:

ðŸŽ­ **Psychological Warfare**: Each audio file should evoke specific emotional responses
- **Yes audio**: Should sound sad, pleading, or desperate
- **No audio**: Should sound relieved but with underlying manipulation
- **Maybe audio**: Should create uncertainty and confusion
- **Background loop**: Should be subtle but persistent, creating subconscious awareness

ðŸ”Š **Technical Requirements**:
- Format: MP3
- Quality: 128-320 kbps
- Duration: 10-30 seconds for trigger sounds, 1-3 minutes for background loop
- Volume: Normalized to -14 LUFS for consistent playback

## Psychological Impact Strategy:

1. **Guilt Induction**: Audio plays only when user tries to leave
2. **Emotional Manipulation**: Messages change based on user behavior
3. **Pattern Interruption**: Unexpected audio triggers create psychological hooks
4. **Lingering Presence**: Background loop maintains emotional connection

## File Naming Convention:
- Use descriptive names that reflect the psychological intent
- Keep filenames lowercase with hyphens
- Include emotional context in filename if possible

Replace these placeholder files with your actual audio files for maximum psychological impact.
